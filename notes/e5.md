- *** your component file not exceed 100 lines (good practice)
- arrow function vs normal function
- Take reference youtube channel
- map , fitler , reduce

# Lets get Hooked
- read about react folder structure - app.js is inside src folder
- seperate files for seperate component
- standard folder structure
- all components are in component folder
- whenever create file for component use component name exactly ex [Header.js] or [Header.jsx](starts with capital letter)
- whenever you have hard coded data never keep inside components file (best practice) ex: resList,cdn url,logo url
- common practice is to keep in the seperate file (constant.js,config.js ,utils.js,common.js)
- utils folder - utilities that used all across your app
- constant.js - starting from small letter because it is not a component

# IMPORT/EXPORT
- two types of export and import
- 1 - Default import/export
   - export default component
   - import component from "path"
- 2 -Named import/export
   - export const Component
   - import { Component } form "path"
- export 1- default export - when you have single export
         2- named export - when you have multilple export
- named export - when you have mulitple export in single file, in one file only one default export in allowed  

- why react fast?? - efficient and faster dom manipulation, virtual dom, recanciliation
- ui layer and data layer should sync eachother so when data changes , ui changes for that we use react hooks - state variable because normal js variable not changes ui layer as data layer changes
- after filtering data changes but ui dont 
- here react uses State variable(super powerful variable) instead of Normal variable
- so here we use React Hooks known as State
- react hook is normal js function- utility function - function comes with some super powers, login written behind the scenes

# React Hooks
(Normal Js utility function)
- Two imp Hooks 
- 1 - useState() - Super powerful state variable in react 
- 2 - useEffect()

- import useState using named import {useState} from 'react'
- useState creates state variable - it maintains state of component
- whenever state variable updates react re-renders the component

# Reconcialiation algorithm (also known as react fibre)
- read react fibre - acdlite/react fibre architecture
- react is fast because it can efficiently manipulate dom - due to virtual dom
- const [list, setList] = useState() - array destructuring
- const arr = useState()
- const [list, setList ] = arr
- const [list] = arr[0]
- const [setList] = arr[1]
