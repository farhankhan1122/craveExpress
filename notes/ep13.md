# Test Cases for out App  ep13 part 1
- we are concerned developing testing but there are so many type of testing
- different type of testing for developer
- Even a single line of code can mess the whole app

## Types of Testing for developers
a. Manual testing
b. [writing the test cases]  - He can write code to test the application

## types of test cases
1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. End to End Testing - E2E Testing

1. Unit testing- you test your react component in Isolation
  - one unit of the app or one component of the app
  - suppose i want to test my header component - i want to test the header component in isolation of the app

2. Integration Testing
    - testing the integration of the components

3. End to End Testing 
     -  testing a react application as soon the user [lands] the website to the user [leaves] the website and we will test different types of flows
     - requires different types of tools cyprus, puppetier , selenium

- as a developer we concern only two types of testing Uint testing and Integration testing
- if you write code you also need to write test cases for those


## ep13 part 2
- what libraries you need while testing
- setup app to be able to do testing

1. React Testing Library (most standard library)
   - this is build using Dom testing library -  so this the base 
   - when you created with create-react-app React testing library have out the box support
   - as we build using parcel from scratch we not integrated the React Testing library 
   - React Testing library using [JEST] behind the scene
   - [Jest]
       - Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. 
       - It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, Vue and more!


### Setting up testing in our app
- Install React testing library
- Installed jest
- Installed Babel dependencies
- configure Babel
- Configure Parcel config file to disable default babel transpilation 

   - npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom    
   - npm install --save-dev jest
   - if you are using with babel you need to install some additional dependencies
   - npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
   - now configure babel like module.export
   - now create a file in root folder babel.config.js and paste the below command
   - module.exports = {
        presets: [['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}]],
      };

- parcel already uses Babel as a transpiler
- but here we are trying to configure babel according to us 
- there will be a conflict between parcel and babel 
- and this will try to overwite the configuration that parcel set for us 
- now we will have to change in parcel configuration
- Configure Parcel config file to disable default babel transpilation
