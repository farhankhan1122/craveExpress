# Lets build our Store [Redux]
- redux is state management library 
- zustand is also state management library (popular)
- redux offer easy debugging

# Redux 
- Predictable state container for JS applications
- two libraries 
1. react-redux
2. redux-toolkit

## Redux store is the big object 
- it is globally centralized


## slices (small portion of the store)
- multiple slices becomes whole store
- why we need slices
- to keep data seperate
- suppose we want to add cart data in store so we create different slice for cart data - [cartSlice]
- initially this [cartSlice] array is empty
- userSlice, themeSlice

- how to write data to store??
- when you click add button it [dispaches] an [action] which calls a [reducer] function which modifies or update the cartSlice of redux store
- suppose want to read data from store???
- for this we use [Selector] to read the data from the store  and this phenomenon is known as [Subscribing] the store
- basically it sync to store whenever the data changes in the store it update automaitcally
