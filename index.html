    <!-- the most constly operation is dom manipulation -->
    <!-- putting some node inside dom and removing some nodes from dom  -->
    <!-- all frameworks and libraries are trying to optimize it -->
    <!-- react also comed with the philosophy that whenever you need to do anything on webpage do it using javascript  -->

<!-- react can be only applied on small portion of our page so we called library -->
<!-- like react can only applied to header only, footer only ,sidenav only -->




<!-- EPISODE-2 -->

<!-- git -->
<!-- git init - initialize your git repository -->
<!-- want to change master branch to main branch use  git branch -M main -->
<!-- local git does not know what is remote so you need to configure "git remote add origin git@github.com:xyz/abc.git"  , this step is used only once -->
<!-- now push to code to remote using "git push origin main" -->

<!-- assignment -->
<!-- git ssh -->
<!-- cross origin -->


<!-- to make your app ready to go in production you need to do lot of processing in your local like "optimize images,remove console ,remove comments"
so that it should minified bundle  -->
<!-- you need to do basically  -BUNDELLING,CODE SPLITTING,CHUNKING ,IMAGE OPTIMIZE -->
<!-- you to need to do lot of processing in to your local before pushing it to the production -->

<!-- NPM -->
<!-- npm does not stands for node package manager it is just a universal package manager -->
<!-- standard repository for all the packages -->
<!-- all the libraries and utilities comes from npm -->
<!-- npm init utitlitly will walk you through creating package.json file-->
<!-- test case : jest  -->
<!-- package.json is the configuration for npm -->
<!-- this packages is also known as dependencies -->
<!-- lets starts installing dependencies  . The most imposrtant package in our project : BUNDELLER -->
<!-- What is bundller: our whole code needs to bundle together,minified,cached,cpmpressed,cleaned before it sent for preduction -->
<!-- what is webpack,parcel,weet  : these are bundler-->
<!-- bundler: bundles your project , it packages your app -->
<!-- when we use create react app , uses webpack bundler and babel behind the scene -->
<!-- In our project we are using PARCEL (we can also use webpack or weet ) -->
<!-- parcel is one of the best library we are going to use in our app , it will ignite our app ,  -->
<!-- parcel comes as a node package we will install that package , now we have npm so we install dependencies -->
<!-- command npm install -D parcel -->
<!-- why we give -D (flag)  -->
<!-- -D we use parcel as a dev dependencies -->
<!-- there are two types of dependecies or packages we install  -->
<!-- 1- Dev dependecies : required in development phase -->
<!-- 2- Normal dependencies : used in production also  -->
<!-- parcel is a bundler ,we use in development phase so we will install parcel as a dev dependencies -->
<!-- parcel gives muscle to our app and it is a beast after installing parcel NODE_MODULELS and package.lock.json files updated -->
<!-- package.lock = keeps the approx version and it is configuration of npm it keeps the track of what version of that version is installed into out system  -->
<!-- package.lock.json = locks the version and keeps the  track keeps the EXACT version of that package -->


<!-- NODE_MODULES -->
<!-- node_modules fetches all the transitive dependencies into our system  -->
<!-- kind of a database where all out packages exist-->
<!-- our project needs parcel dependencies but parcel having its own dependencies
    and  those dependencies have their own dependencies this is known as "TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES"
which are in the node_modules -->
<!-- in our project how many package.json do we have -->
<!-- every dependencies have their own package.json -->



<!-- .gitignore file -->
<!-- the size of node_modules is huge we cant put this on git it is useless 
so any file you dont want to put onto git just put it inside .gitignore file
/node_module -->
<!-- package.json and package.lock.json is imp to put onto git and using this we can 
recreate the node_module (npm install)-->



<!-- we got parcel as a dev dependencies in  package.json because package.json keep track of all the packages and dependencies  -->
<!-- "parcel": ^2.8.3-->
<!-- ^ = Caret : suppose a new minor version of parcel is released 2.8.4 what will happen if you put this caret before version
parcel will automatically upgraded to 2.8.4 -->
<!-- 2.8.4 = is minor upgrade -->
<!-- 3.8.3 = is a major upgrade -->
<!-- ~ Tilde = if you put tilde suppose 3.0.0 major released so tilda upgrade the major version automatically -->
<!-- its ok to upgrade the minor version and not major version   -->

<!-- RECAP HALF EPISODE 2 PART 1-->
<!-- GIT INIT (package.json created)(maintain versions of dep it can Caret or Tilde)
               (package.lock.json)(all the transitive or all the dep that our proj will ever need)
     setup remote repository
     install npm
     if your delete node_modules you can recreate node_modules using npm install
    -->




    <!-- EPISODE 2 PART 2 -->
    <!-- Command npx parcel index.html (the source file)-->
    <!-- now we basically building our app using parcel -->
