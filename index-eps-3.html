<!-- git -->
<!-- git init - initialize your git repository -->
<!-- want to change master branch to main branch use  git branch -M main -->
<!-- local git does not know what is remote so you need to configure "git remote add origin git@github.com:xyz/abc.git"  , this step is used only once -->
<!-- now push to code to remote using "git push origin main" -->

<!-- assignment -->
<!-- git ssh -->

<!--  -->


<!-- to make your app ready to go in production you need to do lot of processing in your local like "optimize images,remove console ,remove comments"
so that it should minimize bundle  -->
<!-- you need to do basically  -BUNDELLING,CODE SPLITTING,CHUNKING ,IMAGE OPTIMIZE -->

<!-- NPM -->
<!-- npm does not stands for node package manager it is just a package manager -->
<!-- standard repository for all the packages -->
